# make-calendar-csv
A small script that I wrote to make a calendar 
(actually, a `.csv` file that can be imported as a calendar) 
with all "Voice" recitals at JHU Peabody.

Last semester (Spring 2016) I took Music Theory III - Songs, 
which required us to listen to two concerts including at least one voice recitals. 
The recitals were listed at http://www.peabody.jhu.edu/events/recitals.html 
which I downloaded as `third_party/example.html` in this repository. 
It was not the most convenient to plan ahead by looking at the original webpage and 
CTRL+F search for voice, since there were quite many voice recitals 
among which I just needed to choose to go to one when I feel like to, 
maybe 30 mins before it starts. 
I am used to keep every event I *may* go to organized in google calendar, 
so I thought it would be nice to have the recitals I'm interested in as a calendar on its own.

This script generates a `.csv` file that can be imported to Google Calendar (and other calendar apps). 
To run, simply do `$ python makecsv.py` which will write a file called `schedule.csv`.
